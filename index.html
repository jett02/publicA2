  <p>
  <body> My name is Jett Phillips, I am currently in my second year at UNO studying in IT Innovation with a minor in Digital Humanities.
In my free time I enjoy working on simple small projects to keep my coding knowledge up to date. I also enjoy spending time with my roommates
here at Scott Village, sometimes going out to Aksarben cinema or the gym. When I'm not at the dorm, I like to spend my evenings cuddled
with my deer-face chihuahua and watch some TV shows or movies. My main goal for the future is to graduate from UNO with a Bachelor's degree
and hopefully get a job opportunity on the west coast, preferably in southern California.
